# 📚 Education

<dl>
<dt>1995-2002</dt>
<dd><a href="https://cvo.berlin/">Carl-von-Ossietzky-Gymnasium</a> in
  Berlin (HC82+M3 Berlin, Germany). We could choose two main subjects
  for in-depth study, mine were <em>Biology</em> and <em>Physics</em>.
</dd>
<dt>2002–2008</dt>
<dd>Studied <a href="https://www.physik.hu-berlin.de/">Physics</a> at
  <a href="https://www.hu-berlin.de/en">Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin</a>. The
  Science Campus is in Berlin-Adlershof (CGMH+4V Berlin, Germany). 
  There I obtained my <em>Diploma</em> (grade: <em>good</em>).
</dd>
<dt>2009-2020</dt>
<dd>Doctoral studies at the <a href="https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/">SimTech Graduate
  School</a>, within the <a href="https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/">University of Stuttgart</a>.
  I worked as a teaching assistent and did research in the area of <em>systems biology</em> 
  within the <a href="https://www.ist.uni-stuttgart.de/">Institute for Systems Theory and Automatic
  Control</a>. I obtained the title of <em>Doktor der Ingenieurwissenschaften</em> (Dr.-Ing.), 
  which is roughly equivalent to a PhD.
</dd>
<dt>2016-2020</dt>
<dd>Postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.kth.se/">KTH Royal Institute of
  Technology</1>, school of <a href="https://www.kth.se/eecs">Electrical Engineering
  and Computer Science</a> (EECS), CST department. I continued to work on the topic of systems biology and
  simulations.
</dd>
<dt>2020, current</dt>
<dd>I work as <em>research specialist</em> at <a href="https://ki.se/">Karolinska
  Institutet</a>, in the <a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/">Science for Life
  Laboratory</a>, Solna (922F+59 Solna).

## Details

These are some of the tasks, duties, and projects I was involved in:

<dl>
<dt>2007–2009</dt>
<dd>During my studies at Humboldt University, I was a <em>student-assistent</em> at the <a href="https://www.zib.de/">Konrad Zuse Institute</a>, Berlin. I worked in the department for <em>high performance computing</em>.
My tasks included scripting, testing of software, and hardware setups. One example is a Gnetoo GNU/Linux
machine that converts incoming email to text messages (SMS) to inform staff of error mesages from the compute cluster (while not at their desks).
This involved Perl and Bash scripting as well as procmail configuration.
</dd>
<dt>2009–2014</dt>
<dd>After graduation from <em>Humboldt University</em>, I began work as doctoral
student and teaching assistent (TA) at the <em>Institute for Systems Theory and Automatic Control (IST)</em>. My responsibilities included:
<ul>
<li>TA for the course <em>dynamics of biological systems</em> (about nonlinear dynamics); TAs design exercise problems, exam problems, and lead the in-person exercise groups.</li>
<li>TA for the course <em>statistical learning and stochastic control</em>; making small statistics demonstrations in <code>R</code></li>
<li>Administration of a small simulation machine (Gentoo, GNU Linux) for the systems biology group</li>
<li>I adminstered the group's library (scientific literature), ordering books, loaning books to students.</li>
<li>supervision of student theses; this is a manuscript that students write before a master's thesis or diploma thesis.</li>
<li>I built a webpage (using a template) for a colloquium at the institute: a registration mechanism, and the program of the event</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>2009–2015</dt>
<dd>As a doctoral candidate, I contributed to articles in proceedings of conferences, made posters, held presentations (as all PhD students do).</dd>
<dt>2012</dt>
<dd>In summer 2012 I was a <em>visiting researcher</em> at University College London (UCL, Statistics Department). There I began contributing to a c library dedicated to Markov chain Monte Carlo. I worked on this library and built an MCMC sampler with it. Lessons from working on this fueled our work on the UQSA r-package.
</dd>
<dt>2019–2022</dt>
<dd>At KTH I continued to assist in teaching as a postdoc. I contributed to the course <em>Applied Programming and Computer Science for physicists</em></dd>

# 💻 Programming Languages

I have come into contact with many programming languages. In some
cases, I had to learn a language for:
<ul>
<li>a specific course at university,</li>
<li>for a specific project started by another researcher,</li>
<li>as part of a summer school,</li>
<li>to finish a task that was given to me by a senior colleague, or advisor.</li>
</ul>

I have had some contact with matlab throughout the years, but on principle, I never use a licensed piece of software, if it can be avoided in any way.

## Ancient History

This is a list of such languages that I have come into contact with,
but didn't use beyond that: [java](https://openjdk.org/),
[prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog),
[haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), c++,
[julia](https://julialang.org/), [perl](https://www.perl.org/) 

> [!NOTE]
> Of these languages I enjoyed perl the most; I worked with it longer than the other entries.

## Core Utils Type Languages

> [!WARNING]
> These languages are used in domain specific UNIX tools and are
> commonly used for _one liners_, and thus aren't always considered
> programming languages.

I use these often, as one liners or otherwise (e.g. as in scripts):
[grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/),
[awk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/),
[sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/),
[bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [POSIX shell](http://gondor.apana.org.au/~herbert/dash/) 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are several implementations of these tools, and dialects of
> their respective languages. The provided links are examples of each tool.

> [!TIP]
> Perl fits into this category as well, it can be used like a core util (with the `-p` flag)

## 📊 Scientific Languages

There are several _scientific languages_, used by researchers
for simulation, visualization of data (plots in articles), statistical
analysis, etc. I am fairly proficient in: GNU Octave (similar to
matlab), and R.

## 📦 Favorites

The language I have enjoyed working with the most is C, with Makefiles
as _build system_.

Of the mentioned languages, these I am most proficient with:

- `C` and `Makefile` (mostly GNU Make)
- `bash`, any POSIX shell and all of the utilities asociated with shell scripting
- `R`
- `GNU Octave` (and by extension matlab)

## 📄 Pretty Text

There are also _programming-language-adjacent_ systems of writing: `html`
& `css`, $\LaTeX$, emacs `org-mode`, `markdown` in its various flavors. 

Of these I enjoy LaTeX the most.

I am a fan of regular expressions, including the `(rx  )` variant in emacs.

# Human Languages

I speak these languages:

- English (pretty well)
- German (like a native)
- Russian (with a german accent, and slowly), but I understand
  everything (probably).

By now I understand a bit of Swedish, but learning Swedish is is a
huge TODO item for me.

member, sometimes as one of the organizers.
