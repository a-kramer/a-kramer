<dl>
<dt>1995-2002</dt>
<dd><a href="https://cvo.berlin/">Carl-von-Ossietzky-Gymnasium</a> in
  Berlin (HC82+M3 Berlin, Germany). We could choose two main subjects
  for in-depth study, mine were <em>Biology</em> and <em>Physics</em>.
</dd>
<dt>2002–2008</dt>
<dd>Studied <a href="https://www.physik.hu-berlin.de/">Physics</a> at
  <a href="https://www.hu-berlin.de/en">Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin</a>. The
  Science Campus is in Berlin-Adlershof (CGMH+4V Berlin, Germany). 
  There I obtained my <em>Diploma</em> (grade: <em>good</em>).
</dd>
<dt>2009-2020</dt>
<dd>Doctoral studies at the <a href="https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/">SimTech Graduate
  School</a>, within the <a href="https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/">University of Stuttgart</a>.
  I worked as a teaching assistent and did research in the area of <em>systems biology</em> 
  within the <a href="https://www.ist.uni-stuttgart.de/">Institute for Systems Theory and Automatic
  Control</a>. I obtained the title of <em>Doktor der Ingenieurwissenschaften</em> (Dr.-Ing.), 
  which is roughly equivalent to a PhD.
</dd>
<dt>2016-2020</dt>
<dd>Postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.kth.se/">KTH Royal Institute of
  Technology</1>, school of <a href="https://www.kth.se/eecs">Electrical Engineering
  and Computer Science</a> (EECS), CST department. I continued to work on the topic of systems biology and
  simulations.
</dd>
<dt>2020, current</dt>
<dd>I work as <em>research specialist</em> at <a href="https://ki.se/">Karolinska
  Institutet</a>, in the <a href="https://www.scilifelab.se/">Science for Life
  Laboratory</a>, Solna (922F+59 Solna).

## Details

These are some of the tasks, duties, and projects I was involved in:

<dl>
<dt>2007–2009</dt>
<dd>During my studies at Humboldt University, I was a <em>student-assistent</em> at the <a href="https://www.zib.de/">Konrad Zuse Institute</a>, Berlin. I worked in the department for <em>high performance computing</em>.
My tasks included scripting, testing of software, and hardware setups. One example is a Gnetoo GNU/Linux
machine that converts incoming email to text messages (SMS) to inform staff of error mesages from the compute cluster (while not at their desks).
This involved Perl and Bash scripting as well as procmail configuration.
</dd>
<dt>2009–2014</dt>
<dd>After graduation from <em>Humboldt University</em>, I began work as doctoral
student and teaching assistent (TA) at the <em>Institute for Systems Theory and Automatic Control (IST)</em>. My responsibilities included:
<ul>
<li>TA for the course <em>dynamics of biological systems</em> (about nonlinear dynamics); TAs design exercise problems, exam problems, and lead the in-person exercise groups.</li>
<li>TA for the course <em>statistical learning and stochastic control</em>; making small statistics demonstrations in <code>R</code></li>
<li>Administration of a small simulation machine (Gentoo, GNU Linux) for the systems biology group</li>
<li>I adminstered the group's library (scientific literature), ordering books, loaning books to students.</li>
<li>supervision of student theses; this is a manuscript that students write before a master's thesis or diploma thesis.</li>
<li>I built a webpage (using a template) for a colloquium at the institute: a registration mechanism, and the program of the event</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>2009–2015</dt>
<dd>As a doctoral candidate, I contributed to articles in proceedings of conferences, made posters, held presentations (as all PhD students do).</dd>
<dt>2012</dt>
<dd>In summer 2012 I was a <em>visiting researcher</em> at University College London (UCL, Statistics Department). There I began contributing to a c library dedicated to Markov chain Monte Carlo. I worked on this library and built an MCMC sampler with it. Lessons from working on this fueled our work on the UQSA r-package.
</dd>
<dt>2019–2022</dt>
<dd>At KTH I continued to assist in teaching as a postdoc. I contributed to the course <em>Applied Programming and Computer Science for physicists</em></dd>

# 💻 Programming Languages

The language I have enjoyed working with the most is C, with Makefiles
as _build system_. No cmake, no autotools.

I am most proficient with:

- `C` and `Makefile` (mostly GNU Make)
- `bash`, any POSIX shell and all of the utilities asociated with shell scripting
- `R`
- `GNU Octave` (and by extension matlab)

Here are more details about programming languages: [programming languages](./programming-languages.md)

> [!NOTE]
> I strongly prefer Free Software over anything proprietary.
> I oppose software patents.
> I like frugality and minimalism in software.

# 💬 Human Languages

I speak these languages:

- English (pretty well)
- German (like a native)
- Russian (with a german accent, and slowly), but I understand
  everything (probably).

By now I understand a bit of Swedish, but learning Swedish is is a
huge TODO item for me.

member, sometimes as one of the organizers.
